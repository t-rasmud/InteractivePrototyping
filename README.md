# A1: Interactive night light
A1/sketch_a1_analogOut: Contains Arduino code that changes the brightness and hue of the RGB LED based on inputs from the 
photocell and the pressure sensor respectively.

Additionally, When the Arduino is connected to a computer, running the script `daemon_script.sh` inside `A1`
updates the html file `A1/rnb_out.html` with the number of times the sequence of rainbow colors has been displayed.
